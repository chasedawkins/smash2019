			<h1>Chase's Life in a Website</h1>
		</div>
		<div>		
		<p>My name is Chase Dawkins, I'm 14 years old,and I'm a first year scholar. I attend Maynard Jackson Highshool and I'm a rising sophmore. My favorite sports are basketball, soccer, and track. I love bacon cheese burgers and my favorite candy is gobstoppers. My favorite colors are red and burgundy. I like red because of how powerful the color is and how it pops. I love burgundy because of how elegant the color is, when I wear it it makes me feel so confident. In my spare time I like to read and play video games because it helps me relax and destress.</p>

		<p> My family is probably the most important thing to me. My sister,my mom,my dad,and my dog kingston are what bring me joy. They are my biggest supporters, feircest protecters, and most loyal people I know. Each one of them embody what type of person I hope to become for that I am truly grateful. They're ability to take any negative situation and turn it positive is amazing. I would also like to include in this rant about my family, my Nana and Granny. Both of those women are my biggest inspirations. I say this because of how they raised my parents. Both of them raised spectacular people who in turn are raisng me to be the same way.</p>
